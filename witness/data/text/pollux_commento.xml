            <p corresp="#poll_p5">Pollux’s first book begins, as the lexicographer
himself states at the end of the prefatory letter to
Commodus (Praef. 1), with what concerns the gods,
the divine, places of worship, priests and
priestesses, the faithful, ceremonies, nouns and
verbs related to cultual and ritual actions and
instruments. The first author quoted by Pollux as an
authority is Homer, for his use of the noun
δαίμονες (‘daimones’) to call to the gods, followed
by Plato, an author very dear to Pollux for both his
Attic languange and his philosophical thought (see
Zadorojnyi 2023).</p></div>
