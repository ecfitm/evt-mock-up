            <p corresp="#brevis_p5">(5) On gods. God and gods and daemons, [who are] gods in Homer. And Plato too called
               ‘the helmsman of the universe’ the ‘greatest daemon’, since the ‘divine’ and the
               ‘daemonic’ have the same use.</p>
            <p corresp="#brevis_p6"> (6) And the place where we worship the gods is ‘holy place’ and ‘temple’; where we
               establish them is ‘sacred enclosure’. The more precise call ‘sacred enclosure
               (τέμενος)’ the one [dedicated] to the heroes, but the poets also that to the gods.
               And the [structure] before [a temple] is ‘prodomos’</p>
            <p corresp="#brevis_p7">(7) and the one behind it is ‘opisthodomos’, and the entrance is ‘propylaia’. What we
               worship are ‘statues (ἀγάλματα)’ ‘xoana’ ‘statues (ἕδη) of gods’, ‘images of gods’,
               ‘raffigurations’, ‘representations’, ‘figures (τυπώματα, εἴδη, ἰδέαι)’. I do not
               approve of ‘bretas (‘wooden image’)’ or ‘deikelon’; upon which we sacrifice or light
               a fire is an ‘altar’, ‘censer’, ‘hestia’: some have named it so. Nonetheless, it
               would be most properly called so [hestia]</p>
            <p corresp="#brevis_p8"> (8) the one in the prytaneion, upon which we kindle the unquenchable fire. ἐσχάρα
               (‘fire-place’) seems to be so called the place upon which we offer sacrifices to
               heroes, some among the poets have also called so the altar of the gods, tough. The
               area within the lustral water (‘περιρραντήρια’) could be ‘sacred’.</p>

            <p corresp="#brevis_p9"> (9) If any part of the sanctuary is not to be trodden, it could be called ‘adyton’,
               ‘untouchable’ and ‘untouched’ (10) ‘secret’, and ‘anaktoron (‘shrine’)’. And places
               let free to the gods are ‘groves (ἄλση)’, and ‘sacred precincts (τεμένη)’ and
               ‘enclosures (ἕρκη)’, and the circle around them is ‘peribolos’. What within it is
               inviolable, it is called also ‘place of of escape (φύξιμον), and [it is] safety for
               the suppliants. The land let free for the gods is ‘holy soil’ and ὀργάς (‘sacred
               land’).</p>
