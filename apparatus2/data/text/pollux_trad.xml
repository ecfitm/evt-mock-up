            <p corresp="#poll_par1" xml:id="poll_trad_par1" n="1">(5) God and gods and daemons; for thus Homer seems to call the
               gods daemones. And Plato too called ‘the helmsman of the universe’ the ‘greatest
               daemon’, since the ‘divine’ and the ‘daemonic’ have the same use.</p>
            <p corresp="#poll_par2" n="2" xml:id="poll_trad_par2">(6) And the place where we worship the gods is ‘holy place’ and
               ‘temple’; where we establish them is ‘sacred enclosure’ and a ‘precint’; for the more
               precise call ‘sacred enclosure (τέμενος)’ the one [dedicated] to the heroes, but the
               poets also call so that to the gods, as the tragedians ‘to the sacred enclosure of
               god.’ And the [structure] before [a temple] is ‘prodomos’,</p>
            <p corresp="#poll_par3" n="3" xml:id="poll_trad_par3">(7) and the one behind it is ‘opisthodomos’, and the entrance is
               ‘propylaia’. What we worship are ‘statues (ἀγάλματα)’, ‘xoana’, ‘statues (ἕδη) of
               gods’, ‘images of gods’, ‘raffigurations’, ‘representations’, ‘figures (τυπώματα,
               εἴδη, ἰδέαι)’. I would not approve ‘bretas (‘wooden image’)’ or ‘deikelon’ ⌠because
               they are poetic⌡. Upon which we sacrifice or light a fire is an ‘altar’, ‘censer’,
               ‘hestia’: some have named it so. Nonetheless, it would be most properly called so
               [hestia] </p>
            <p corresp="#poll_p8">(8) the one in the prytaneion, upon which the unquenchable fire is
               kindled. ἐσχάρα (‘fire-place’) specifically seems to be so called the place upon
               which we offer sacrifices to heroes, some among the poets have also called so the
               altar of the gods, tough. The area within the lustral water (‘περιρραντήρια’) could
               be ‘sacred’, ‘holy’, ‘consecrated’, ‘hallowed’, ‘inviolable’ – although I have not
               yet encountered this word – </p>
            <p corresp="#poll_p9">(9) the area outside is ‘profane’, for ‘unholy’ would be more
               appropriate for impure places. If any part of the sanctuary is not to be trodden, you
               could call this ‘adyton’, ‘untouchable’ and ‘untouched’ </p>
            <p corresp="#poll_p10">(10) ‘secret’, and ‘anaktoron (‘shrine’)’. And places let free to
               the gods are ‘groves (ἄλση)’, and ‘sacred precincts (τεμένη)’ and ‘enclosures
               (ἕρκη)’, and the circle around them is ‘peribolos’. And if some place is inviolable,
               say this ‘place of refuge (κρησφύγετον)’ and ‘of escape (φύξιμον)’, and ‘holy
               boundaries’, within which there is safety for the suppliants. And the land let free
               for the gods is ‘holy soil’ and ὀργάς (‘sacred land’).</p>
